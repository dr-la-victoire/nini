      <h2>Nini's Song</h2>
      <p>
        I'll sing a song for Nini, One just for her, <br />For she's not like
        the others, She towers over the crowd, <br />Created so lovely, The gods
        would be proud. <br />The words from her lips form the loveliest sound,
        <br />A song just for Nini, One just for her.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll sing a song for Nini, One just for her, <br />Her beauty radiating
        both loud and discreet, <br />From the crown of her head to the soles of
        her feet.<br />
        The boys are struck dead as she crosses the street, <br />I'll play the
        song for Nini, The one just for her.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll sing a song for Nini, God help me if I can, <br />With her mind so
        rich and her heart so pure. <br />If you have a problem, she's there
        with the cure.<br />
        Perhaps I've been smitten, I'm dying for more. <br />Give me more songs
        for Nini, The ones just for her.
      </p>

      <p>
        What more can I say? I'm glad that she came, <br />Although I'm a jerk,
        She still saved my name. <br />The Sovereign Chess Player Has done it
        again, <br />
        She's the jewel I'll care for again and again, <br />I'll sing my best
        for Nini, A song just for her.
